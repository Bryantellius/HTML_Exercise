        Hello everyone! My name as you can already see is Douglas Green. I am
        from the Boston Massachusetts area. Lived here my whole life outside of
        a few years. I have two children who I obviously love dearly. Katreina
        who is 16 (yikes) and Marcus who is currently 7 years old. I have a long
        background of computer systems. Though This boot-camp is the only formal
        training I have received. You can think of me as mostly a hobbyist when
        it comes to computer systems and software design. Moving forward, feel
        free to reach out to me if you ever need any help. I do have a wide
        range of knowledge when it comes to the content that we are learning in
        this boot-camp at TrueCoders. I am friendly and enjoy helping others.
        Can't wait to see everyone at graduation day!

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I
        asked. "The point," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to
        <u>play</u> a beautiful game." He lifted his hands and shrugged, his
        face breaking into a <em>beautiful</em> smile. "Why would I want to win
        anything other than a beautiful game?"
